# Code Book

In order to complete the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project, one must make a series of modifications to the original variables names contained in the files provided by the instructor. Files are available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

Please refer to [README](README.md) for additional details.

### Changes in variable names

The final tidy dataset contains changes to the labels below. These changes were performed in order to improve human readability. 

* "t" was replaced with "Time"

* "f" was replaced with "Frequency"

* "Gyro" was replaced with "Gyroscope"

* "Mag" was replaced with "Magnitude"

* "BodyBody" was replaced with "Body"

* "mean()" and "meanFreq()" were replaced with "Mean"

* "std()" was replaced with "Std"


Finally, this is the complete list of variables in our tidy dataset. 

* "Subject" 

* "Activity" 

* "TimeBodyAccelerometer-Mean-X"
